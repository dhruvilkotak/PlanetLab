Motivation:

Internet path stability measurement is one of the important aspects in internet architecture and
communication. It may help us to predict the properties of network paths, in designing the realtime
routing protocol to recreate or migrate state stored in the routers and provide better routing
facility to the desired path. It helps to learn about network conditions from past observations that
are carried out. Another advantage of internet path stability is, the information obtained can be
used to carry out the best effort delivery and to avoid the traffic control packet loss.

Methodology:

The analysis was carried out using 7 pair of nodes (14 Nodes), to deal with the problem of
failure of nodes. Out of those 7 pairs, 5 working pair of nodes were used to carry out
analysis. From them we have one trans pacific and one trans-Atlantic node to get the analysis
for the nodes which are geographically spread and observe the difference what we get from
the other nodes for better understanding of analysis.
 First, I created a python script to get the trace and ping measurement was made which runs
on my local machine. It runs automatically and saves log data to the local machine every day.
 The same python script is used to retrieve data
